# Tiger-Problem-POMDP
Implementation of POMDP algorithms (value iteration and point-based value iteration) on the tiger problem, as described in Littman, Cassandra and Kaelbling (1998).
## Usage

using valueIteration.py to play with the game. You can input what you here to get the bext action to take
